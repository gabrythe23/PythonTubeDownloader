# PythonTubeDownloader
Small python script to download youtube videos/playlists.

# How does it work?
Simply run it with python "python Main.py" (Tested on Ubuntu 16.04)

Enter your requested YouTube video/playlist

It will then download the playlist/videos into the Downloads folder.

I don't do python often, so please feel free to make edits and tell me what I could have done better!

Thank you :)
